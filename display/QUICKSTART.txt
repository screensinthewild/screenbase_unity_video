Just want to put together a quick and dirty program of remotely hosted videos?

Format:

http://<your site>/<your directory containing video player app>/?&remote=<'y' or 'n'>&vids=<MP4 video1>~~<MP4 video2>~~<MP4 video3>&sharing=<'y' or 'n'>&subtitles=<'y' or 'n'>&loc=<location code used by 'Screens in the Wild' to identify screen node>&info=<URL encoded text to display when info button is touched>&branding=<URL encoded text for short title to appear on-screen>&call=<URL encoded text to appear under the video>&skin=<JPG image to skin app with>

To manually encode URLs or Info text, use: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/

or..use the ScreenBase screenbase_unity_video module to encode everything for you. This will work locally by running Create's index.html or try it at:
